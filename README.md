## About the project

Makers Academy requirement: "We would like a web application that allows users to list spaces they have available, and to hire spaces for the night."


## Specifications

We decided our Minimum Viable Product (MVP) specifications should be:

* User can sign up
* User should  log in
* User can list a new space.
* User can list multiple spaces
* Space can have name, description, and a price
* A user can request to hire any space
* Approval by the user that owns that space
* Owner can make space available manually


## User stories

From our MVP specifications, we wrote a list of [user stories](docs/user_stories.md).

Example user story:
```
As a new user,
So that I can use Howdy Partners BnB,
I want to sign up for an account.
```


## Basic class diagram

We used our user stories to write a [class diagram](docs/class_diagram_v1.svg) for a User class and a Property class.

## Control flow diagram - Sign up page

We wrote control flow diagrams for the main routes on our site:

* [Sign up page](docs/signup_control_flow.svg)


* [Add new properties](docs/new_property_listing_control_flow.svg)


* [View properties](docs/view_properties_control_flow.svg)
